# Clicky Game

## Overview

Clicky Game is a memory game with React.

1. The application renders different images of Marvel characters to the screen.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game gets restarted.
